# Data-Structures
Implementing data structures in C/C++
1. Trees

- Structure of a tree
- Inorder, Preorder Post Order Traversals using Iteration


2. LinkedLists
a) Singly linked Lists:
    - Reverse a LL using pointers (in place, iteratively and recursively);
    - Add nodes at head, or at nth position
    - Delete a node at nth position.
    - Traversal - > recursively.
    - Remove duplicates (from a sorted and unsorted list)
